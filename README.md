# Tinfoil
Tinfoil is a small and lightweight wrapper for Discord's REST and Gateway API, written in Typescript and designed with scalability in mind. It leaves a lot of stuff up to the user, allowing for more fine-tuned control over how your bot interacts with the API.

It is best to think of Tinfoil more like a general utilities library for working with Discord's API, rather than a feature-complete library such as [discord.js](https://discord.js.org).
